# Desktop Build Issues

## Current Issue: Rust Toolchain Compatibility

**Problem**: The desktop application build is currently failing due to a dependency chain issue where the `pxfm` crate v0.1.23 requires the `edition2024` Cargo feature, which is not yet stabilized in the current Rust toolchain (1.82.0).

**Error Message**:
```
feature `edition2024` is required

The package requires the Cargo feature called `edition2024`, but that feature is not stabilized in this version of Cargo (1.82.0 (8f40fc59f 2024-08-21)).
Consider trying a newer version of Cargo (this may require the nightly release).
```

## Current Build Status

- ✅ Tauri configuration updated for cross-platform support
- ✅ Rails assets compilation working
- ❌ Rust compilation failing due to dependency chain
- ❌ Desktop app binaries not generated

## Potential Solutions

### Option 1: Update Rust Toolchain
```bash
# Install nightly toolchain with edition2024 support
rustup install nightly
rustup default nightly

# Or use nightly for this project only
rustup override set nightly
```

### Option 2: Pin Dependencies to Compatible Versions
Update `Cargo.toml` to use older, compatible versions of dependencies that don't require `edition2024`.

### Option 3: Wait for Stable Release
Wait for `edition2024` to be stabilized in the stable Rust release.

## Workaround for Release Directory

For demonstration purposes, the release directory structure has been created with placeholder files. Once the build issue is resolved, actual binaries can be generated using:

```bash
# Build all platforms
./scripts/prepare-release.sh 0.5.0

# Or build individual platforms
npx tauri build --target aarch64-apple-darwin  # macOS ARM
npx tauri build --target x86_64-apple-darwin   # macOS Intel  
npx tauri build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc # Windows
npx tauri build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu # Linux
```

## Files Affected

- `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` - Rust dependencies
- `src-tauri/src/main.rs` - Simplified to avoid problematic features
- `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` - Cross-platform configuration
- `scripts/prepare-release.sh` - Build automation script

## Next Steps

1. Monitor Rust stable releases for `edition2024` stabilization
2. Test with nightly Rust toolchain if immediate builds are needed
3. Update dependency versions once compatibility issues are resolved
4. Generate actual binaries and replace placeholder files
